# Kinetic.JS Smart Package
Meteor smart package that wraps [KineticJS](http://www.kineticjs.com), the enterprise-class interactive web graphics package.

KineticJS is an HTML5 Canvas JavaScript framework that enables high performance animations, transitions, node nesting, layering, filtering, caching, event handling for desktop and mobile applications, and much more.

At the moment, this smart package simply wraps __version 5.1.0__ of KineticJS. At some point, it may be nice to actually reference the KineticJS source code and have a more proper build process to keep up to date.

Installation instructions: `mrt add kinetic.js`
