# Kinetic.JS Smart Package
Smart package that wraps [KineticJS](http://www.kineticjs.com) for MeteorJS use.

At the moment, this smart package simply wraps __version 4.7.2__ of KineticJS. At some point, it may be nice to actually reference the KineticJS source code and have a more proper build process to keep up to date.

Installation instructions: mrt add kinetic.js
